Every year, he would sit on his porch and wait for that final leaf to drop, symbolizing the end of one chapter and the beginning of another.\n\nAs the snowflakes grew thicker, a young girl named Lily appeared at the edge of George's yard, her eyes fixed on the tree. She had moved in next door just days ago, but something about the old man's quiet vigil caught her attention.\n\nGeorge noticed Lily and beckoned her over. As she approached, he handed her a pair of gloves. \"It's almost time,\" he said, his voice low and gravelly.\n\nTogether, they watched as the last leaf of autumn detached from its branch and began to fall. It danced in the air, its edges curling up like a smile, before settling gently on George's porch floor.\n\nIn that moment, George felt a sense of closure, knowing another year had come and gone. Lily, too, felt a connection to this stranger, sensing that their chance encounter was the start of something new \u2013 a story that would unfold with each passing autumn, and every last leaf that fell.
